This project is **dead** now. (Of course you're welcome to fork it.)

You can still use it of course, but as I no longer use Windows, I can't continue
to develop it.

About This Source
=================

I have *no idea* what I was doing before I stopped working on this project,
so *I don't know if it's broken, or if it even compiles at all*. Know this
before you go using this.

**Note:** This is *not* the source for whatever the last public version was.
This is my development source.

In any case, have fun with it if you don't mind looking at my horrible code. :)
