<h1 class="first">KwikStrip Documentation</h1><p>
	Thanks for grabbing a copy of KwikStrip! This help page should let you know how
	everything works. I'll try not to get too programmatic, but that's the way I think.
	Anyway, there is a topic list over there, you can use it to jump around. Have fun
	using KwikStrip, I hope it serves as an excellent application management solution.
	<br/><br/>
	This document covers Version 2.5 the information might be inaccurate or completely void if
	you are using an older version. You can upgrade here at the
	<a href="http://biohazard.drdteam.org/kwikstrip.php">KwikStrip page</a>.
	<br/><br/>
	Oh, I should also point out that any icons shown on the strip in any of the screenshots
	on this page (or anywhere for that matter) are the property of their respective owners,
	but you knew that already right?
</p><div class="sub">
	<a name="what"></a><h2>What is KwikStrip?</h2><p>
		KwikStrip is an application launcher, but more specifically, it's this:
		<br/><img src="arrow.png" alt="[KwikStrip Arrow]"/><br/>
		Okay, that doesn't look like much. That's the point. KwikStrip is designed to take as
		little amount of space as possible until you tell it to spring to life by clicking on
		it. Then it opens up to reveal your buttons. Like this:
		<br/><img src="strip.png" alt="[KwikStrip Strip]"/>
	</p><a name="why"></a><h2>Why should I use it?</h2><p>
		Well, there are several reasons why you should at least <i>try</i> KwikStrip:
		</p><ul>
			<li>Navigating through the Start Menu is a pain.</li>
			<li>The Start Menu is especially evil if you have installed a zillion programs and
				the Start Menu is full of a zillion submenus and in most cases you aren't even
				sure where all those submenus came from...</li>
			<li>Sometimes it's impossible to organize the Start Menu due to user account
				restrictions.</li>
			<li>Using the built-in QuickLaunch bar wastes valuable taskbar space. Especially
				when you need to add 20 or 30 items. KwikStrip solves this problem. I've
				personally seen strips as large as 140 buttons!</li>
			<li>Forget searching the Start Menu, launching an application with KwikStrip is
				simple as Click, Click, Done!</li>
		</ul>
	<a name="faq"></a><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>
		I haven't been asked many questions yet, (is that a good or bad thing? ;) ) but when I
		get some that are asked frequently, I'll put them here.
	</p><a name="bugs"></a><h2>How to report a bug</h2><p>
		KwikStrip has been in development for a long time. I've worked out nearly all the bugs.
		Version 2.5.6 is very stable. Nevertheless, I'm not perfect so the chances of my
		program being perfect are pretty slim. If you do happen to find a bug, there's a
		<a href="http://biohazard.drdteam.org/bugs.php">bug tracker on my web site</a> so go
		check that out. If the problem isn't already listed, you can report it using the handy
		<a href="http://forum.drdteam.org/viewforum.php?f=38">bug report area of my forum</a>.
		<br/><br/>If you are reporting a crash, make sure to post everything that comes out of
		the crash dialog and your config/ini file. Also <i>make sure you describe what you were
		doing when the bad stuff happened</i>. Nothing is worse than reporting a big problem
		where I can't figure out how you got it.
	</p>
</div>

<h1>Getting Started</h1><p>
	Kwikstrip isn't difficult to install and use. I've tried to keep it very simple. For the
	sake of completeness, here's installation and basic usage instructions.
</p><div class="sub">
	<a name="install"></a><h2>Installing KwikStrip</h2><p>
		Installing KwikStrip depends on how fresh you want it. In most cases, you will want to
		grab the latest official version from my site on the
		<a href="http://biohazard.drdteam.org/kwikstrip.php">KwikStrip page</a>. If you want
		it hot out of the oven, you will need to check-out a copy from the SVN server.
		<br/><br/>Once you have a .zip, .tar.bz2 or even just the .exe, Just drop it in a
		folder somewhere and run it. No installation, no funky registry stuff, now weirdo
		wizards.
		<br/><br/>
		If you want KwikStrip to start when you turn on your computer, make a shortcut in your
		start menu's "startup" folder. You could do a registry thing too, but KwikStrip will
		never ever touch the registry so you'll have to do it yourself. It's pretty easy, just
		fire up RegEdit and browse to:
		</p><pre>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</pre><p>
		Then add a key named "KwikStrip" and set the value to wherever you put KwikStrip.exe.
		<br/><br/>
		I prefer the startup folder method since I tend to move KwikStrip around a lot and
		startup is easy to update.
	</p><a name="additem"></a><h2>Adding an item</h2><p>
		The first time you start KwikStrip, it will ask you to configure it, click "yes" to
		enter the configuration dialog. Ignore all the pretty knobs and switches. In the
		lower-left corner there is a button labeled "add", you want that. Hit it now to enter
		the item properties dialog. Type in the name of the program under "Application Name"
		and click the "..." button next to Executable/File/Directory/URL path and find the
		.exe using the file browser thing. Ignore everything else, We'll talk about that stuff
		later in the <a href="#advitem">Optional item features</a> section. Click "OK" when
		you're finished.
		<br/><br/>
		Now that you have an item (conveniently shown in the item list), you can run
		KwikStrip, but why would you want a strip with only 1 item? Take some time to add more
		items and fill out your strip. When you're done adding items, click "OK" to save your
		configuration and start KwikStrip for real.
	</p><a name="main"></a><h2>The main window</h2><p>
		The main window is quite simple, containing only 3 parts:
		<br/><img src="main.png" alt="[KwikStrip Main Window]"/>
		</p><ol>
			<li><b>The Arrow:</b> The arrow is what opens and closes the strip. Without it,
				KwikStrip would use up a ton of screen space all the time and nobody wants
				that now do they?</li>
			<li><b>Buttons:</b> KwikStrip's buttons are what launch the applications you
				define in the configuration. Just a single click and away you go.
				<br/>Right-clicking on a button will bring up a special menu with extra
				launching options. These options are covered in the
				<a href="advlaunch">Extra Launching Features</a> section.</li>
			<li><b>The "InfoBox":</b> The InfoBox displays the item title of the button your
				mouse pointer is hovering over or just the version of KwikStrip is running.
				<br/>Right-clicking on a button will bring up the system menu which will bring
				up the configuration or on-line help.</li>
